# Flutter Project - Movie Review App and Sliding Puzzle Game

## Description

This project was completed as part of my studies and received a score of 19.5/20. It consists of two main parts:

1. **TP1: Movie Review Application**
   - This application allows users to browse and leave reviews for various movies. The interface is intuitive, making it easy to navigate through movies and their reviews.

2. **TP2: Sliding Puzzle Game**
   - In this section, I developed a sliding puzzle game with multiple stages and difficulty levels. This game includes a selection menu that allows users to choose between the different exercises.
